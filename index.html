  <p id="name"> Anastasia Trushchankova </p>  </center>
  <p> I am a high school student at <a href="https://lhs.fuhsd.org/">Lynbrook High School</a> who loves to learn, try new things, and be spontaneous with my friends. I am a part of my school’s varsity volleyball team, and I play for Eclipse Volleyball Club. I also partake in numerous clubs on my campus from CSF, a service organization, to interest clubs such as Women in STEM (WiSTEM) and Cardio Med. During my free time, I like to spend time with my family and friends, read, and go camping. This summer I am participating in Girls Who Code summer immersion program at Cadence Design Systems.</p>

  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
  <center><img alt="Photo of a forest because spending time outdoors is one of her hobbies" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/03/19/41/forest-1950402_1280.jpg" height="300"> </center>
  <p>	I have many hobbies and sometimes spread myself thin. I dance contemporary and jazz, play volleyball, and I did TaeKwonDo for eight years. I have been dancing at my local studio for a decade now, and I plan to continue because it relieves stress and brings me joy. I started playing volleyball in middle school, and after making varsity my freshman year, I joined club volleyball to better my skills and confidence in the sport. I also enjoy being in nature and seeing beautiful sights. I also enjoy reading and watching movies. </p>

  <h2> Skills </h2>
  <p> I have a second-degree blackbelt certified from Kukkiwon, World Taekwondo Headquarters. I am also okay at juggling my interests while attempting to stay balanced.</p>

  <h2> Favorite Food </h2>
  <p> My favorite foods include crepes and fruit. </p>

  <h2> Places to Travel </h2>
  <p> I would like to travel to numerous countries in Europe. </p>
